        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Bhutan's history spans from early settlements (c. 2000 BC) to Buddhist introduction (8th Century by Guru Rinpoche) and unification in 1616 by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, who established a dual religious/secular system. After civil strife, Ugyen Wangchuck unified the nation, becoming the first hereditary monarch in 1907, starting the Wangchuck dynasty. Bhutan remained isolated but transitioned to a constitutional monarchy in 2008, focusing on development under the GNH (Gross National Happiness) philosophy. </p>
        <p>Bhutan is a tiny and remote kingdom nestling in the Himalayas between its powerful neighbours, India and China. Almost completely cut off for centuries, it has tried to let in some aspects of the outside world while fiercely guarding its ancient traditions.</p>
        <h1>Kings of Bhutan</h1>
        <p>Ugyen Wangchuck (1st King): Reigned from 1907 to 1926, establishing the Wangchuck dynasty and modern Bhutan. </p>
